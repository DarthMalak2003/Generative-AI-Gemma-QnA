# Generative-AI-Gemma-QnA
This project fine-tunes the Gemma language model on a QnA database to provide accurate responses to user queries. We also enable the model to include external documents as a knowledge base for improved response accuracy. Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the model combines text generation with information retrieval for better context and relevance.

Key tools used include Python, LangChain, HuggingFacePipeline, and PyTorch. The goal is to develop a versatile QnA system that delivers high-quality, context-aware answers.
